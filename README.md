# CV Website Backup
## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to have a backup copy of the files for my hosted portfolio website.

## Features & Functionality
 - About Section
 - Skills Section
 - Portfolio Section
 - Contact Section/Form
 - Particles.js background
 - Vanta.js Waves / Three.js wave animation in footer

## Known Issues
three.min.js & particles.min.js files are too big - impacting loading time for mobile

## Notes
Might not be possible to reduce the file size of three.min.js & particles.min.js as they are 26k lines of JS code when beautified, and the loading time impact is minimal.
